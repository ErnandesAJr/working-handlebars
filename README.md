## 📑 About

This repository was created with the intention of storing functions made in **HandleBarsJS** that were very useful in the development of some applications using the **Dojot** platform.

---

## 👀 How to use

These resources were created to be used in the [**Dojot template node**](https://github.com/dojot/flowbroker/blob/development/orchestrator/nodes/template/index.js). But they can be used in any environment that uses **HandleBars**.

If the features are not in the main [**Dojot**](https://github.com/dojot/flowbroker) repository, I use some of that functionality in [**my fork**](https://github.com/ErnandesAJr/flowbroker) 😎 of the platform, with some more features. You can also use my [image Docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ernandesjunior/flowbroker).

If you want to add other features that I’m not using or new ones that you’ve created, I recommend that you make your own fork (💥 **Enjoy the fact that it’s open** 💥❕).

## 🛂 Where to test

To quickly test the created HandleBars functions just access an example present in the documentation use the [playground](https://handlebarsjs.com/examples/helper-this-context.html) to test the functionality

Just copy and paste the "handlebars.registerHelper()" you want with the name "Handlebars.registerHelper()" instead of "handlebars" (the "H" must be capitalized). **So see in the comment on the function how to use it!**
